# Pipfile & Pipfile.lock
#
# When developing libraries, it is generally recommended to exclude
# Pipfile and Pipfile.lock from version control [1]. Notably, including
# Pipfile in the repo is fine when it is used to specify development
# dependencies (e.g., tox), as long as the file does not repeat abstract
# dependencies that are already defined within setup.py [2].
