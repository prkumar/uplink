Uplink üì°
==========
A Declarative HTTP Client for Python. Inspired by `Retrofit
<http://square.github.io/retrofit/>`__.

|Release| |Python Version| |License| |Coverage Status|

.. note::

   Uplink is currently in initial development and, therefore, not
   production ready at the moment. Furthermore, as the package follows a
   `semantic versioning <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#semantic-versioning-preferred>`__
   scheme, the public API outlined in this documentation should be
   considered tentative until the :code:`v1.0.0` release.

   However, while Uplink is under construction, we invite eager users
   to install early and provide open feedback, which can be as simple as
   opening a GitHub issue when you notice a missing feature, latent defect,
   documentation oversight, etc.

   Moreover, for those interested in contributing, checkout the `Contribution
   Guide on GitHub`_ ('tis `Hacktoberfest`__, after all)!

A Quick Walkthrough, with GitHub API v3:
----------------------------------------

Using decorators and function annotations, you can turn any plain old Python
class into a self-describing consumer of your favorite HTTP webservice:

.. code-block:: python

    from uplink import *

    # To register entities that are common to all API requests, you can
    # decorate the enclosing class rather than each method separately:
    @headers({"Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3.full+json"})
    class GitHub(object):

        @get("/users/{username}")
        def get_user(self, username):
            """Get a single user."""

        @json
        @patch("/user")
        def update_user(self, access_token: Query, **info: Body):
            """Update an authenticated user."""

To construct a consumer instance, use the helper function :py:func:`uplink.build`:

.. code-block:: python

    github = build(GitHub, base_url="https://api.github.com/")

To access the GitHub API with this instance, we simply invoke any of the methods
that we defined in the interface above. To illustrate, let's update my GitHub
profile bio:

.. code-block:: python

    r = github.update_user(token, bio="Beam me up, Scotty!").execute()

*Voila*, :py:meth:`update_user` builds the request seamlessly (using the
decorators and annotations from the method's definition), and
:py:meth:`execute` sends that synchronously over the network. Furthermore,
the returned response :py:obj:`r` is simply a :py:class:`requests.Response`
(`documentation
<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#requests.Response>`__):

.. code-block:: python

    print(r.json()) # {u'disk_usage': 216141, u'private_gists': 0, ...

In essence, Uplink delivers reusable and self-sufficient objects for
accessing HTTP webservices, with minimal code and user pain ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

   .. todo::

      Most of this guide is unfinished and completing it is a planned
      deliverable for the ``v0.2.0`` release. At the least, this work will
      necessitate adding docstrings to the classes enumerated below.
