"""
This module defines proxy exceptions that enable end-users to catch
client exceptions in an agnostic manner.

The initial plan was to define some common exception classes, then have
client writers register the appropriate client-specific exceptions as
virtual subclasses (similar to abc.ABCMeta).

However, that approach fails because, when determining if a thrown
exception should be caught, Python does an explicit subtype check,
bypassing any special subclass checks we can define (e.g.,
__subclasscheck__). See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23891850

The workaround employed here maintains the need for client writers to
register their exceptions. For each registered exception, we generate a
subclass that is a child of both the client exception and the proxy
exception to which the writer registered it.

When a client-raised exception is thrown, the client layer attempts to
exchange the client error for a subclass generated in the previous step.
If the exchange is successfully, end-users can catch the subclass
exception using either the proxy exception or the original exception.
