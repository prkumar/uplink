# Non-Blocking Requests with Uplink

This example details how you can use the same Uplink consumer with different
HTTP clients, with an emphasis on performing non-blocking HTTP requests.

## Requirements

Support for `twisted` and `aiohttp` are optional features. To enable these
extras, you can declare them when installing Uplink with `pip`:

```
# Install both clients (requires Python 3.4+)
$ pip install -U uplink[twisted, aiohttp]

# Or, install support for twisted only (requires Python 2.7+):
$ pip install -U uplink[twisted]

# Or, install support for aiohttp only (requires Python 3.4+):
$ pip install -U uplink[aiohttp]
```

Notably, while `twisted` features should work on all versions of Python that
Uplink supports, the `aiohttp` library requires Python 3.4 or above.

## Overview

The example includes three Python scripts:

- `github.py`: Defines a `GitHub` API with two methods:
  - `GitHub.get_repos`: Gets all public repositories
  - `GitHub.get_contributors`: Lists contributors for the specified repository.

The other two scripts are functionally identical. They each use the `GitHub`
consumer to fetch contributors for 10 public repositories, concurrently. The
only difference between the scripts is the HTTP client used:

- `asyncio_example.py`: Uses `aiohttp` for awaitable responses to be run with
  an `asyncio` event loop.
- `twisted_example.py`: Uses `requests` with `twisted` (inspired by
  [`requests-threads`](https://github.com/requests/requests-threads))
  to create `Deferred` responses.
